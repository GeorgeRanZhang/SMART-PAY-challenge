# SMART-PAY-challenge
Here is the smart pay challenge.

After spending time reading the requirement, I've decided to work mainly for #1 MANPAN Processing and #3 Transaction Transmission. 

To implement #1, I've spend sometime using sketch to make a simple UI design.

<img src="UI screenshot.png" height = 200/>

This follows the given UI shown on the request. I also add a home view that user can choose which type they want on the home screen. To reduce time spent on Sketch I did not add the animation on it.
